<p align="center"> Using data from a Portugesse bank,our task is to classify which customers of the bank are likely to subscribe to a term deposit or not. Here we employ various machine learning algorithm so as to classify the customers. We explore the data using Tableau and preprocess it using various python libraries before creating our machine learning models.
